164,"In the suit the defendant/petitioner herein entered an appearance and filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC contending, inter alia, that the suit is barred by limitation and so, the plaint should be rejected",Premise
164,That application was rejected by the impugned order,Claim

164,"The petitioners have contended that Hari Mohan got the plot n.o. 30, Tilak Narag Colony and he died on February 8, 1991, as a widower",Premise
164,He had no issue and so his brother Moni Mohan inherited the property left by Hari Mohan,Premise
164,"Moni Mohan died on March 3, 1992 leaving behind the plaintiffs as his legal heirs",Others

164,The defendant has no connection with Hari Mohan but he has contended that his sister namely Anita Kundu became the owner of the property of Hari Mohan by dint of a deed of settlement,Premise
164,"A suit being Title Suit N.o. 137 of 2001 before learned Civil Judge (Senior Division), 5th Court, Alipore was filed by the defendant against one person set by him as Shymal Saha wherein, it has been mentioned that Anita Kundu became the owner of the suit property by dint of the deed of settlement from Hari Mohan and after the death of Anita Kundu intestate as a spinster leaving behind the defendant as her heir and by the decree of compromise, the defendant became the owner of the property left by Hari Mohan",Others
164,"The plaintiffs have also contended that fraud was practised and thus, a fictitious deed of settlement had been made and so, the said suit being Title Suit N.o. 44 of 2010 was filed by the heirs of Moni Mohan stating the cause of action to file the suit",Others
164,"Thereafter, the defendant filed the said application which was rejected by the impugned order",Premise
164,"So, this application has been preferred",Claim
164,"Upon hearing the learned Counsel for the parties and on going through the materials on record, I find that the rejection of the plaint has been sought for on the ground of limitation and it is contended by Mr. S.P. Roy Chowdhury, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner, that the suit must be instituted within three years from the date when the deed of settlement had been made by Hari Mohan in favour of Anita Kundu or from the date when such fact came to the knowledge of the petitioners",Premise

164,"He has also referred to the decision of Kanailal Das & anr.  vs  Jiban Kanai Das & anr. Reported in AIR 1977 Cal 189 thus, he has submitted that the limitation of the right to sue under Article 58 being three years should be counted from the date of knowledge",Others
164,"So, in the instant case, as per materials on record when the matter came to the knowledge of the plaintiffs in the year 1992, it should be presumed that the suit must be filed within three years from the date of knowledge",Premise
164,"The instant suit having been filed in the year 2010 is not maintainable and so, the suit comes within the mischief of Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the CPC",Premise
164,"On the other hand, Mr. S.P. Mukherjee, learned Advocate appearing for the opposite parties has contended that since there is an allegation of fraud, a judgment or decree obtained by playing fraud on the Court is a nullity and non est in the eyes of law",Others
164,"It can be challenged in any Court even in collateral proceedings, according to the decision of S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (Dead) by LRS  vs  Jagannath (Dead) by LRS & anr. reported in 1994 (1) SCC Page 1",Premise
164,Fraud is to be decided on the basis of evidence,Claim
164,It was also decided in 27 CWN 587 (Division Bench Judgment) to the effect that evidence is required for determination of the fraud as contended in the plaint,Claim

164,"At 30, Tilak Nagar Colony under P.S. Jadavpur, Kolkata 700040 i.e. within the jurisdiction of the learned Court",Others
164,"So far as the rejection of plaint on the ground of being barred by limitation is concerned, only the plaint is to be looked into to see whether on perusal of the same it appears to be barred by the law of limitation",Premise
164,"In the instant case, there being a contention of fraud on the part of the plaintiffs against the defendant, the ground of fraud could be established only by evidence and not by mere averments in the plaint",Premise
164,"Therefore, the learned Trial Judge, in my view, has rightly observed that it is not possible to hold whether the suit is barred by the law of limitation or not",Claim
164,Evidence is required to determine this issue,Claim
164,"In my opinion, the learned Trial Judge has rightly addressed the issue",Others
164,"Accordingly this application is devoid of merits and is, therefore, dismissed",Claim
